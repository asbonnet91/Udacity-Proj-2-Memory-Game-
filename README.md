# Memory Game Project (Concentration)

This is a Memory Game Project as distributed by Udacity in which students build upon starter code to create a fully functional game of Concentration. While it is completed, the game will continue to recieve updates in functionality and design.

## Instructions
Please use the JS, CSS and HTML files in the same folder, otherwise the game will not be able to open.

## Known Bugs 
There is an apparent bug with the time increment functionality. The timer tends to speed up abnormally after one completed game. It also continues to run after restart despite the time interval having been cleared according to the debugger.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome upon review. Thank you and enjoy!
